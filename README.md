### Visualize Data

```python
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
fig, ax = plt.subplots(3,1, figsize=(7, 7))

for i,job_titles in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_Ger_plot = df_skill_count_Ger[df_skill_count_Ger['job_title_short'] == job_titles].head(5)
    #df_Ger_plot.plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill counts', ax=ax[i], title=job_titles)
    sns.barplot(data=df_Ger_plot, x='skill counts', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='job_skills', palette='dark:b')
    #ax[i].invert_yaxis()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,4500)
    ax[i].set_ylabel("")
    ax[0].set_xlabel("")
    ax[1].set_xlabel("")
    ax[i].set_title(job_titles, fontsize=12)

plt.suptitle('Counts of Top Skills in Job Posting(Germany)', fontsize=15)
plt.tight_layout()
